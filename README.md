Our target is to search products in different market places, see their availability and compare their prices. For this we have created a remote database in neo4j based on various products from 4 categories available at Market Places like amazon, ebay, Target, Walmart, Bestbuy. Categories are : Electronics, Furniture, Toys and Books.

Furthermore, 5 business questions were designed to do market analysis. Then on the basis of cypher queries graphs were created in neo4j.
